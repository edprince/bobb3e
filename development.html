            Our original design was a maze filled with objects and obstacles,
            that the robot could solve, removing/reacting effectively to
            anything in its path.

        <div class='full-width'>
          <p class='description'>
            Due to encountering many problems, mostly physical, we decided to
            simplify the game somewhat. The main two problems were the optical
            sensor position, and the forklift/object shape. The sensor was
            positioned to the right of the robot, making it very difficult to
            follow a line to its left. The forklift was also not strong enough
            to cope with a heavy object (without the object falling off), or
            without unintentionally dropping a light object due to rough
            movement when turning.

        <div class='full-width'>
          <p class='description'>The algorithm works on an always-try-left
            principle. At any intersection, the robot will try and check the
            path to its left. If it finds a path, it will follow it, if it
            doesn't find the path, it will turn back onto its original route. If
            it finds blank space in front of it, it will spin 180 degrees and
            move back along the path the other direction.<p>

        <h1 class='massive'>Inaccurate Tiles</h1>
        <div class='full-width'>
          <p class='description'>After creating the first prototype of the maze,
          we realised that the robot was going to struggle with a maze that was
        not consistent. Therefore we had to spend time re-making the tiles to
        very specific dimensions, with the maze path aligning at perfect right
        angles throughout the maze.</p>
