        <p class='description'>
          In the initial weeks of the project, after familiarizing ourselves
          with the capabilities of the robots, we meed an open document to begin
          brainstorming ideas.
        </p>

      </div>


      <div class='ws'>
        <p class='description'>
          Finally, we decided to draw upon a combination of aspects we liked,
          primarily: a maze, and the object picking up and repositioning. This
          built the fundamentals of our game.

          <h1>Incorrect Object Size</h1>
          <p class='description'>
            Bobb3e was unable to pick up the majority of objects we tested, and
            none consistently.

          <h1>Incorrect Object Size - Solution</h1>
          <p class='description'>
            We developed a lightweight object out of cardboard that wouldn't
            slide off, due to a flap on the inside of the object.

          <h1>Failure to recognize colours</h1>
          <p class='description'>
            We found consistently that Bobb3e could not distinguish some
            colours, in particular yellow, especially if it lay in shadow.

          <h1>Failure to recognize colours - Solution</h1>
          <p class='description'>
            We reduced the number of colours required throughout the maze,
            limiting the game to colours we knew Bobb3e could consistently
            distinguish correctly.

          <h1>Disproportional tile sizes</h1>
          <p class='description'>
            Due to inaccurate tiles, and consequently skewed angles of pathways,
            Bobb3e would often deviate from the pathway, making him wander the
            maze randomly. He also didn't respond well to overlapping card,
            creating a shadow.

          <h1>Disproportional tile sizes - Solution</h1>
          <p class='description'>
            We spent time creating accurate tiles, with precise measurements and
            angles, making Bobb3e capable of solving the maze far more
            consistently.
